# 🌟 Azure DevOps Java CI Pipeline Notes (Maven + Artifacts) 🚀

---

## 📌 Overview

This document explains the **Java CI Pipeline** setup using **Maven**, **Copy Files**, and **Publish Artifact** tasks on a **Self‑Hosted Agent** in Azure DevOps.

---

## 🧱 1. Maven Build Task (pom.xml) 🏗️

### **Task: Maven pom.xml**

- This step **builds your Java project** using Maven.
- It runs your `pom.xml` with the chosen goal (usually `package`).

🔧 **Key Inputs:**

- **Maven POM file:** `pom.xml`
- **Goal(s):** `package`
- **Azure Resource Manager connection:** _Used only when deploying to App Service later, not required for Maven build._

📌 Output: A compiled Java application, often in the form of a `.jar` file.

---

## 📂 2. Copy Files Task 📁

This step copies your built files to the **Artifact Staging Directory**, preparing them to be archived or published.

🔧 **Settings:**

- **Source Folder:** `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)`
- **Contents:** `**` (copy all files and folders)
- **Target Folder:** `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`

💡 `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` is a built‑in Azure DevOps folder used for preparing artifacts.

---

## 📤 3. Publish Artifact Task 📦

This step creates the final **build artifact** that can be consumed by a Release Pipeline.

🔧 **Settings:**

- **Path to publish:** `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`
- **Artifact name:** `drop`
- **Publish location:** Azure Pipelines

📌 Result: A folder named **drop** containing your packaged Java files.

## 🧠 Notes on Variables 🤓

### ✔ `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)`

Where Azure DevOps downloads your repository.

### ✔ `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`

Temporary folder used for packaging artifacts before publishing.

### ✔ `**`

Wildcard meaning **copy everything**.

---

## 🏁 Summary 🎯

Your Java CI pipeline performs:
1️⃣ **Build using Maven** (`pom.xml` + `package` goal)
2️⃣ **Copy artifacts** into the staging area
3️⃣ **Publish artifacts** as `drop` for release pipelines

Perfect structure for deploying to **Azure App Service**, **AKS**, or **VMs** later. 🚀
